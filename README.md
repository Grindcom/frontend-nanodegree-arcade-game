# Arcage Game
## Game Play
Use the arrow keys to move the player icon around the board.
## Scoring
Get the player icon to the top lane (water) to get a point.
## Lives
Player starts with 3 lives. If the player hits a bug or is run over by one they loose a life (heart).
## Restart
To restart the game, refresh the browser.


Enemies start at random x locations as well as in random danger lanes (the cobble blocks). When the enemy finishes their track, they start again in a different, randomly selected track.
Global variables for lane height and column width allow changes to the view of the game.  These are currently added to app.js  
### Add/change the following variables  
  * `var laneHeight` (default is 83)
  * `var columnWidth` (default is 101)

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
